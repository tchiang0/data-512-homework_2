    "# Requesting ORES scores through LiftWing ML Service API\n",
    "Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) is reworking access to their APIs. It is likely in the coming years that all API access will require some kind of authentication, either through a simple key/token or through some version of OAuth. For now this is still a work in progress. You can follow the progress from their [API portal](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Another on-going change is better control over API services in situations where those services require additional computational resources, beyond simply serving the text of a web page (i.e., the text of an article). Services like ORES that require running an ML model over the text of an article page is an example of a compute intensive API service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikimedia is implementing a new Machine Learning (ML) service infrastructure that they call [LiftWing](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Machine_Learning/LiftWing). Given that ORES already has several ML models that have been well used, ORES is the first set of APIs that are being moved to LiftWing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates how to generate article quality estimates for article revisions using the LiftWing version of [ORES](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES). The [ORES API documentation](https://ores.wikimedia.org) can be accessed from the main ORES page. The [ORES LiftWing documentation](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Machine_Learning/LiftWing/Usage) is very thin ... even thinner than the standard ORES documentation. Further, it is clear that some parameters have been renamed (e.g., \"revid\" in the old ORES API is now \"rev_id\" in the LiftWing ORES API).\n",

Keep in mind, documentation from IBM is specific to their implementation of the JWT standard. Access tokens are composed of different parts that specify the domain being accessed and rate limits.

    "The API request will be made using a function to encapsulate call and make access reusable in other notebooks. The procedure is parameterized, relying on the constants above for some important default parameters. The primary assumption is that this function will be used to request data for a set of article revisions. The main parameter is 'article_revid'. One should be able to simply pass in a new article revision id on each call and get back a python dictionary as the result. A valid result will be a dictionary that contains the probabilities that the specific revision is one of six different article quality levels. Generally, quality level with the highest probability score is considered the quality level for the article. This can be tricky when you have two (or more) highly probable quality levels."
